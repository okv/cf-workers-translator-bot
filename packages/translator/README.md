# Translator package

This is a very minimalistic library to translate text.

It uses [Google Cloud Basic Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest/v2/translate), but tries to keep its interface implementation agnostic, so that it can be changed easily.

A usage of this package would be:

```ts

```
